=head1 NAME

TPath::Context - the context in which a node is evaluated during a search

=head1 VERSION

version 1.006

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basically a data structure holding all the different bits of information that may be useful
to selectors, predicates, or attributes during the evaluation of a node. This class simplifies
method signatures -- instead of passing a list of parameters one passes a single context.

A C<TPath::Context> is a blessed array rather than a hash, and it is a non-Moose class, for a 
little added efficiency. Note, that for still greater efficiency it is sometimes treated as an
array rather than an object, so it must be regarded as a final class not to be tampered with
or extended.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 previous

Returns the context of the node selected immediately before the context node.

=head2 first

Returns the first context in the selection history represented by this context.

=head2 n

The context node.

=head2 i

The L<TPath::Index>.

=head2 path

The previous nodes selected in the course of selecting the context node. These ancestor
nodes are in reverse order, so the node's immediate predecessor is at index 0.

=head2 expression

The expression the context is being used by. This attribute is not guaranteed to be set and
the method, unlike the other accessors, is a setter as well as a getter.

The contextual attribute is available for use by L<TPath::Attributes>, which set the attribute
when they are applied to a context.

=head2 to_string

The stringification of a context is the stringification of its node.
