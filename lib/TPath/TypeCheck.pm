=head1 NAME

TPath::TypeCheck - applies type constraint on nodes

=head1 VERSION

version 0.016

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role of an object that checks the class of a node against the class it knows it can handle.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 _typecheck

Expects a node. Confesses if the node is of the wrong type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 8

=item node_type

If set on object construction, all nodes handled by the C<TPath::TypeCheck> will have 
to be of this class or an error will be thrown. Can be used to enforce type safety. 
The test is only performed on certain gateway methods -- C<TPath::Expression::select()> and 
C<TPath::Index::index()> -- so little overhead is incurred.
