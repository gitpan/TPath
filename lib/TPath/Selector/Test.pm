=head1 NAME

TPath::Selector::Test - role of selectors that apply some test to a node to select it

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<TPath::Selector> that holds a list of L<TPath::Predicate>s.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 f

Reference to the associated forester for this test. This is used in obtaining
the test axis.

=head2 axis

The axis on which nodes are sought; C<child> by default.

=head2 first_sensitive

Whether this this test may use a different axis depending on whether it is the first
step in a path.

=head2 is_inverted

Whether the test corresponds to a complement selector.

=head2 node_test

The test that is applied to select candidates on an axis.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 candidates

Expects an L<TPath::Context> and whether this is the first selector in its path
and returns nodes selected before filtering by predicates.

=head1 ROLES

L<TPath::Selector>
